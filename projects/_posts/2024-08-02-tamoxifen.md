# Abstract

Tamoxifen is a drug that is commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. It is classified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which means it can modulate activity at the estrogen receptor. Tamoxifen is unique because depending on the tissue in which it acts, it can act as both an estrogen agonist or antagonist, which leads to a variety of both positive and negative side effects. The most commonly reported side effect of patients taking tamoxifen is a hot flash, which can interfere greatly with patients quality of life and causes many patients to stop use of the drug. Our lab aims to understand the mechanism in which tamoxifen acts in the brain, more specifically the hypothalamus, which is the main regulator of physiological homeostasis, to mitigate the negative side effects while maintaining the positive side effects of the drug.
