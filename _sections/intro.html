  <h2 class="alt">The <strong>van Veen lab</strong> at
    UCLA.</h2>
  <p>Our team is investigating how the nervous system, cancer, and cancer therapies interact.
    We use mice as a model because of the sophisticated molecular tools available
     for observing and perturbing neural function, and because mice develop tumors
     and respond to chemotherapy in ways strikingly similar to humans.
