Single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, enabling us to explore gene expression at an unprecedented level of resolution. However, the complexity of scRNA-seq data demands sophisticated computational techniques and user-friendly interfaces that empower researchers from diverse backgrounds to harness its full potential. We have developed a suite of web-based tools that enable users to explore and analyze scRNA-seq data without the need for programming expertise. 


In 2020, we profiled [heterogeneity of the ventromedial hypothalamus](rdcu.be/b3xKk). You can query genes of interest in our dataset to explore their expression [here](https://correalab.shinyapps.io/natmetabshiny/). You can also examine coexpression of genes of interest with other genes in the ventromedial hypothalamus.

In 2021 we profiled the response of various neural cell types to the cancer drug, tamoxifen. You can explore the differential expression of genes of interest in neurons and different types of glial cells [here](https://correalab.shinyapps.io/tamoxifenshiny/).
