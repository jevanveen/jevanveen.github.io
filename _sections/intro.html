  <h2 class="alt">Hi! I'm <strong>Ed van Veen</strong>, an onco-neuroscientist at
    UCLA.</h2>
  <p>I'm interested in how cancer interacts with the central and peripheral
    nervous systems. This includes how cancer therapies affect brain controlled
    physiology and how tumor evolution selects for cancers that communicate
    bidirectionally with the nervous system.</p>
