  <h2 class="alt">Hi! I'm <strong>Ed van Veen</strong>, a Project Scientist at
    UCLA.</h2>
  <p>I'm interested in how cancer interacts with the brain. This includes how
    cancer therapies produce side effects, and how tumor evolution selects
  for cancers that communicate bidirectionally with the brain.</p>
