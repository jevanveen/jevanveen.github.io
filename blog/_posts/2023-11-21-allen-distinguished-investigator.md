Professor van Veen was recently named as an Allen Distnguished Investigator. We are beyond grateful to the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org) for their regonition and support. 
This funding will allow us to pursue collaborative projects between the van Veen lab and the labs of Stephanie Correa and Annegret Falkner. Together, we will reveal the cellular and molecular effects of sex hormones beyond their roles in reproduction. Our overarching goal is to illuminate the wide-ranging impact of sex hormones on various biological processes.
