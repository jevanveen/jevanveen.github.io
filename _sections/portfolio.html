<p>Our recent work is in the area of <h2>women's health and quality of life.</h2>
  Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogenic therapy widely prescribed for breast cancer treatment and prevention.
  While tamoxifen is a critical weapon in the fight against breast cancer, it unfortunately
  imparts a number of side-effects that affect women's quality of life including hot flashes,
  bone pain, deep vein thrombosis, lethargy, and increased risk of endometrial cancer.
  Our goal in this project is to separate the bad effects from the good so that
  one day soon, women could take anti-estrogen therapy to prevent and treat breast
  cancer without fear of debilitating changes in quality of life. </p>

  <p> In the publication below, our team showed that tamoxifen-induced changes in
    body temperature, bone density, and movement, all absolutely require estrogen
    receptor-alpha expression in the hypothalamus. This exciting work indicates that
    while tamoxifen protects against breast cancer through direct action in the tumor,
    it promotes side effects via the brain. Now we are heavily focused on precisely
    which populations of brain cells cause each side effect, how they do it, and if
    we can use a secondary drug to block these side effects.</p>

<p> The previous work by Dr. van Veen included studies of how estrogen sensitive
  neural nodes regulate mouse physiology, and also how common lung cancer mutations
  cause tumor progression and de-differentiation. </p>
