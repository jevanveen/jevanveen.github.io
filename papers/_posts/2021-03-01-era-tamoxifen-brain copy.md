# Abstract

Tamoxifen is a critical and inexpensive weapon in the fight against ER+ breast cancer.
Unfortunately tamoxifen therapy produces side effects that harm quality of life
and limit treatment compliance. Here we present 4 important findings: <br>
1. Mice respond to tamoxifen therapy in many of the same ways as humans, making
mice a valuable model for studying tamoxifen's side effects. <br>
2. Tamoxifen treatment affects various hypothalamic cell types, most strikingly
neurons and ependymal cells. <br>
3. Loss of estrogen receptor-alpha reverses
