    <p class="lead">Hormone signaling in the brain — from molecular tools to systems neuroendocrinology.</p>

    <h3>How do cells respond to hormones?</h3>
    <p>Our big but simple question is "how do cells respond to hormones?" Specifically, we are a neuroendocrinology focused lab working on the effects of sex steroids in the brain. We use a combination of molecular biology, in vivo animal studies, in vitro cell work, and bioinformatics. We are studying multiple levels of steroid effects, from hormone and receptor binding to physiology and disease.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> estrogen/androgen signaling; receptor dynamics; hormone-responsive gene programs</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> viral reporters (e.g., SeeER), single-cell & spatial transcriptomics, imaging & automated analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Models:</strong> mouse, primary cells, engineered lines</li>
    </ul>
