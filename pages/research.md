We ask how hormone signals are sensed, decoded, and turned into cellular state changes.

#### Themes
1. **Receptor presence vs. response** — separating ER/AR expression from functional transcriptional output.
2. **Regional & cellular heterogeneity** — mapping where and when estrogen responses occur across hypothalamic nuclei.
3. **Dynamics** — capturing transient vs. sustained responses and their physiological correlates.

#### Approaches
- **Reporters:** transcription‑coupled fluorescent reporters (e.g., *SeeER* family) for live tracking of estrogen‑responsive cells.
- **Omics:** scRNA‑seq/ATAC‑seq for state & identity; bulk‑seq for perturbations; integrative analyses.
- **Physiology:** OVX/E2 paradigms, cyclic tracking, metabolism & behavior readouts.

#### Why it matters
Sex steroids influence far more than reproduction, shaping metabolism, thermoregulation, cancer risk, and brain function. Understanding *where* and *how* these signals act enables targeted interventions in women’s health and beyond.
