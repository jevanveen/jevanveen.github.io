  <h2 class="alt">I'm <strong>Ed van Veen</strong>, an onco-neuroscientist at
    UCLA.</h2>
  <p>I'm investigating how the nervous system, cancer, and cancer therapies
     interact. We use mice as a model because of the sophisticated molecular tools
     available for observing and perturbing neural function,
     and the ability to recapitulate many aspects of human carcinogenesis using engineered mutations. </p>
