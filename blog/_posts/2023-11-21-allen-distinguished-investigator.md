Professor van Veen was recently named as an Allen Distinguished Investigator. We are beyond grateful to the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/division/frontiers-group/distinguished-investigators/optical-tools-for-visualizing-sex-hormones-as-drivers-of-dynamic-internal-states/) for their regonition and support. 

This funding will allow us to pursue collaborative projects between the van Veen lab and the labs of [Stephanie Correa](https://correalab.org) and [Annegret Falkner](https://falknerlab.com). Together, we will reveal the cellular and molecular effects of sex hormones beyond their roles in reproduction. Our overarching goal is to illuminate the wide-ranging impact of sex hormones on wide range of physiology.
